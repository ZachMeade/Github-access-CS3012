## CS3012 Github Access Assignment
For the first part of the assignment we were asked to interogate the github API to retrieve data about the users on the platform. This data include basic profile details such as name, bio, number of followers etc.  
In the second part of the project we had to visualise the data. This was done mainly through react.js, hmtl and css. To graph the data pulled from the i used Plotly
In my first graph, I took data from all the repos of a user and graphed the amount of stars they have on each repository. Furthermore,I used ghchart.rshah.org to get the commit heat map for each of the users.
For my second graph i graphed the amount of forks  vs the amount of watchers on a repo
